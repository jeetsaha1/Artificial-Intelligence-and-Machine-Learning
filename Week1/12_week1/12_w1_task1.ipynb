Why are Python loops inefficient for similarity computation ?\n","\n","# Ans.\n","# Answer:\n","#  Python loops are inefficient for similarity computation due to the following reasons:\n","# Interpreted execution:\n","#  Python loops are executed line-by-line by the interpreter, which introduces significant overhead in terms of type checking,\n","#  memory management, and loop control. This overhead does not contribute to the actual computation.\n","\n","\n","# Poor cache utilization:\n","#  Loop-based element-wise access does not efficiently utilize CPU cache and vector registers, leading to slower execution when\n","#  processing large numerical datasets.\n","\n","\n","# Scalability issues:\n","#  Similarity computation involves comparisons between thousands of users and products. Using loops results in very high time\n","# complexity, making real-time computation unacceptable for users.\n","\n","\n","# 4. Justify how vectorization improves performance and readability.\n","\n","# Answer:\n","# Vectorization improves performance and readability in the following ways.\n","\n","\n","# Reduced interpreter overhead:\n","#  Vectorization minimizes explicit Python loops, thereby reducing interpreter overhead and improving execution speed.\n","\n","\n","# Efficient data traversal:\n","#  Operations are performed on entire arrays at once, making better use of CPU cache and hardware optimizations.\n","\n","\n","# Improved readability:\n","#  Vectorized code is shorter, clearer, and more expressive, closely resembling mathematical notation and reducing\n","#  the chance of logical errors.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"pfuMPUVhNei1"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"BNDn5N6rMLT5","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1768380091568,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":13,"user":{"displayName":"JEET SAHA","userId":"13114831331575986165"}},"outputId":"58f696e0-9d9b-428d-8616-ec8c5e271c9b"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Dot Product of u and v: 32\n","Cosine Similarity: 0.9746318461970762\n"]}],"source":["# 2.
